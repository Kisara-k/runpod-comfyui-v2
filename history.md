1. step by step guide to run a serverless runpod endpoint for pony diffusion v6 xl in pdxl image. Browse the necessary documentation and create the .md files with clear steps to set this up and use, while also writing the necessary code. You must NOT create a docker image, and use this worker https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-comfyui

2. Specifically asked to NOT to make a docker file and use the pre existing one at https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-comfyui


3. based on this documentation, and the expected request format for the image we used, create a .env and notebook to test the endpoint, returning images.
